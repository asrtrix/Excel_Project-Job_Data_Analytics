# My Excel Job Data Analytics Project
 Through my analysis of job data, I developed a valuable resource that includes both a user-friendly Salary Dashboard and an in-depth Salary Analysis report.  

 ## Salary Dashboard  
 This Salary Dashboard aims to equip job seekers with the knowledge they need to confidently negotiate their salaries and make informed career choices within the data field.

 ## Salary Analysis
 As a data science student, I've always been curious about the evolving job market and eager to understand the most in-demand skills and salary expectations. This project was driven by a desire to gain a deeper understanding of the data science landscape and equip myself with the knowledge to make informed career decisions.
